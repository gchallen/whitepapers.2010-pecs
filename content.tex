\section{Vision}

Throughout the history of computing, testbeds have played major roles in
advancing research. Multiple areas have reached a point at which small,
limited, single-experiment instrumentation failed to provide the power, scale
and realism needed to make progress. At each critical juncture, research
communities conceived and built shared infrastructure that
helped carry their field forward.

We believe that smartphone research has reached this critical moment.
Smartphones are one of the most rapidly-adopted technologies in human history,
and conference proceedings are bulging with papers attempting to harness the
power of this emerging technology. As the smartphones change the way that we
communicate and interact, scientists from a broad range of disciplines are
anxious to study its effects and unlock its potential. But all of these efforts
are stalled by the lack of a testbed remotely approximating the reality we are
witnessing.

We envision a publicly-available smartphone testbed called \emph{PhoneLab} that
enables smartphone operating system and mobile application research in a
realistic environment at a scale not previously possible. PhoneLab will consist
of a large number of (say 1,000) reprogrammable Android devices used by
students, staff, and faculty in a university campus, and will be supported by a
back-end data center. PhoneLab will provide \emph{power}, allowing the
modification of smartphone software above and below the OS-application
interface, while simplifying instrumentation and data collection to
facilitate efficient experimentation. PhoneLab will provide \emph{scale},
allowing researchers access to an order of magnitude more participants
than typically used by smartphone studies. By minimizing experimental
disturbance, PhoneLab will provide \emph{realism}, ensuring that participants
use their smartphones as they would normally. Compared to the Apple AppStore
or Android Market, PhoneLab will present a controlled, yet realistic
environment with a large number of participants in one location. We believe that
this will readily enable experiments on emerging research issues such as
social networking, cyber-physical systems, smart environments, smartphone
sensing, and crowd-sourcing. In addition, access to the operating
system layer allows PhoneLab experimenters to perform studies that cannot be
performed via the Apple AppStore or Android Market. We believe
%that PhoneLab will accelerate research on phone cloud applications, networking,
%infrastructure, and system software, providing a standardized environment
%where experiments can be validated and competing approaches compared.
that PhoneLab will accelerate research on smartphone-related areas,
providing a standardized environment where experiments can be validated and
competing approaches compared.

We believe that our vision for PhoneLab can enable the next-generation of mobile
cloud computing research by providing the above-mentioned power, scale, and
realism. Considering the research impact of other similar testbeds --- EmuLab
and PlanetLab on networking and distributed systems as well as MoteLab on sensor
networking --- we anticipate that PhoneLab can accelerate mobile cloud computing
research. In order to make this vision a reality, we are working on the
first prototype of PhoneLab.

\section{Potential Advances} To demonstrate the kinds of research that PhoneLab
will enable, we identify four main research areas PhoneLab will help advance. 

\emph{Applications:} PhoneLab will enable the community to tackle emerging
research issues in a wide array of application domains such as crowd-sourcing,
social networking, user interaction, environmental sensing, and epidemiology
studies. For example, PhoneLab would provide a realistic experimentation
platform for collecting smartphone sensing data, e.g., time-activity data of the
environment for pollutant exposure estimation. PhoneLab could also assist
the development of more realistic models such as human mobility models or
social network models that will help advance the relevant research.

\emph{Infrastructure:} PhoneLab will also enable research into infrastructural
issues such as environmental interaction, task distribution, and new wireless
technologies. For example, we believe that PhoneLab can be instrumental in
designing and developing of the cloud-backed smartphone infrastructure, which
uses nearby computers or data centers. There are many research issues involved
in this general direction, such as off-loading of computation, hierarchical
storage designs that extend the limited smartphone storage to data centers, and
privacy and security issues that arise when utilizing data centers.

\emph{Networking:} PhoneLab will provide a great platform for networking
research such as multi-radio issues, delay-tolerance, and peer-to-peer.
Many research project investigate ways to utilize multiple communication
technologies --- voice, SMS, WiMax, WiFi, Bluetooth --- each with its own
capabilities and limitations. PhoneLab is the perfect testbed to experiment
with an integrated networking layer that attempts to divide traffic between
multiple radios to improve performance. Moreover, 4G is slowly gaining
popularity among wireless providers, but there is little scientific study
that reports 4G behaviors in the wild. PhoneLab will be a perfect testbed for
this purpose.

\emph{Operating Systems:} PhoneLab will allow researchers to modify OS
components, and help investigate issues such as mobile operating system
design, distributed systems, energy management, and fault-tolerance. Operating
systems issues will be easily tested and compared on PhoneLab as experimenters
will have access to the same group of participants with the same usage patterns
over time. For example, experimenters can run a number of different energy
management schemes over the span of a few weeks and compare their behaviors.

%PhoneLab will consist of three layers --- phone, infrastructure, and
%interface --- and we briefly describe how they work together to provide its
%core functionality.
%
%\emph{Phone:} More than 1,000 next-generation Android
%phones to PhoneLab participants. Android platform is chosen
%because it is the only open-source mobile device operating system
%currently available.  Access to the operating system layer allows
%PhoneLab experimenters to perform studies that cannot be performed via
%the Apple Store or Android Market.
%
%\emph{Infrastructure:} The infrastructure component of
%PhoneLab will consist of 4G base stations and server infrastructure installed
%on campus. 4G access points allow us to provide data access to our
%participants for free --- a significant participation incentive --- while
%producing a next-generation smartphone environment for experimentation. A
%back-end data center will collect and store experimental data for further
%analysis, while also allowing users to run code interacting with software
%deployed on the phones.
%
%\emph{Interface:} The access layer will consist of interfaces used
%by both users and participants. Users will use their interface to design,
%schedule, and monitor their PhoneLab experiments. Participants will use
%their interface to track the experiments they are part of and monitor the
%information being collected about them.

Louisiana.
